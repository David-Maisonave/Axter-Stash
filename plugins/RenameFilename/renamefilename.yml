description:   "Renames video (scene) file names when the user edits the [Title] field located in the scene [Edit] tab.
                The file is renamed after user clicks save button.
                Tags are appended to the file name if the tag does not already exist in the original file name.
                Features are configurable using the renamefilename_settings.py.
                Note: On Windows OS, the file can not be renamed while it's playing. Refresh the URL to allow file release and rename."
